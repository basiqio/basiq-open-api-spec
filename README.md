## Swagger/Open API spec for the Basiq API  

### What is Open API? 
The OpenAPI Specification, previously known as the Swagger Specification, is a specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.

### What do I do with this repo?
We are currently in the process of updating our client SDK's, so in the meantime we have given the public access to our spec to help you get up and running ASAP. 

We have a directory for each version of the API, and in each is their respective `swagger.json` file, containing the full specification. This allows customers to generate SDK's and server-stubs in many languages using [SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/), or online using their [editor](https://editor.swagger.io/). 

### Versions 
- 2.0 `stable`
- 2.1 `beta`
